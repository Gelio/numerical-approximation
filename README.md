# Numerical approximation using empirical formulas
This repository is an application that approximated a given function f: R -> R using empirical formulas with the following base:
1, x, x^2, sin x.

It then plots the approximated function, as well as approximation nodes.

All the comments inside, as well as the documentation is in Polish. Variable names are in English, so the main concept is easily understandable without any Polish langauge knowledge.

This project is a task for Numeric Methods 2 on the [MiNI](http://www.mini.pw.edu.pl/tikiwiki/) faculty at [WUT](https://www.pw.edu.pl/).
